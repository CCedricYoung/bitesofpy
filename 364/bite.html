<p>Lorem Ipsum is text used to demonstrate layout in documents (such as web pages) without distracting reviewers with real content.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorem_ipsum" target="_blank" rel="noopener">This article</a>&nbsp;describes it nicely. Innovative developers have made a number of different&nbsp;lorem ipsum generators to mix it up a little, using themes like bacon or&nbsp;pirates.</p>
<p>In this Bite, we want to create lorem ipsum text using words we scrape using <a href="https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BeautifulSoup</a> from a Wikipedia featured article of the day.</p>
<p>We don't use the live page, we work with this static copy (which will be loaded in) so we can reliably test your code. While not part of the Bite, a bonus next step would be to allow a date argument and use this to choose the article from which to grab those words.</p>
<p><strong>HINT:</strong> BeautifulSoup takes in a parameter to tell it what type of parser to use. I suggest using <code>html.parser</code>.</p>
<p>Make sure the sentences are well-formed - with an uppercase letter at the start of each sentence and a period at the end of each.</p>
<p>Keep calm and code in Python!</p>
